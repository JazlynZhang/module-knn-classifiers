**With Team Members:** Shubham Gaikwad **,** Varshin Bhaskaran **,** Saurav Makam **,** Bhanu Kirrann Garikipati **,** Shoumik Kumbham

1. I understand what they are trying to do. They want to get real-time insights into public emotions and opinions through Twitter using topic modeling and Siamese networks. I think the approaches are good and interesting.

2. The gaps they mentioned is about the election predictions now largely depend on traditional polls with a limited demographic and might not capture the full range of public sentiment. However, I think that users of Twitter may not be representative of the broader population since they tend to be younger or affiliated with particular political or socioeconomic groupings and sometimes the Twitter platform might limit the exposure of some specific standings to the publuc.

3. Their approach is to use topic modeling and Siamese networks to explore the information through Twitter. I think 2 months is feasible. But to avoid bias, I think it would be better to combine the polls with Twitter all together.

4. Yes, those needs shape the team's analysis by asking them to ensure accuracy and avoid bias.

5. The team identified the risks as the ethical concern in the data usage. I also worried about the processing of this huge amount of data since there are new posts every single second on Twitter.

6. There timeline is is reasonable and seems feasible. 

## For: proposal 3 (I don't know who's in the team)

1. They clearly identified their purpose that they want to assist expectant mothers in taking care of their health at home, with an emphasis on early detection and prevention of gestational diabetes.

2. Yes, I am conviced of the need. Early intervention is pivotal and even more helpful than timely diagnosis.

3. They plan to use multiple aspects of data to build a ML model to do thr early-predict analysis. 2 months period is feasible as long as they have the dataset that is ready to use.

4. They successfully identified the beneficiary. This early prediction model will help both pregnant women and fetal Life. Based on the needs, the team should pay attention to the diverse backgrounds and health histories of pregnant women.

5. The team identified the risks as data privacy and ethical considerations in handling sensitive health information. This is definatily worth noting since there might be unauthorized access to some private health informaiton and may lead to inaccurate predictions.

6. There timeline is clear and seems feasible.
